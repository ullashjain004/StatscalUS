Population Mean

What is Mean?

Population mean is basically the average of an entire group. It is derived by calculating the sum of the group and then dividing the sum from the number of entities in that group.

The below formula explains each element utilized.

μ = (Σ * X)/ N
where:
Σ means “the sum of.”
X = all the individual items in the group.
N = the number of items in the group.

Utilization of Mean in our Code

We used a randomly generated distribution of 200 values. We calculated the mean by adding all values and dividing it by 200.
