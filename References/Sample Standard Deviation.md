# Sample Standard Deviation

## What is Sample Standard Deviation?

Sample Standard Deviation is when we take a random sample from the entire population and calculate the standard deviation for the randomly selected sample.

Calculating the Sample Standard Deviation

In order to calculate the sample standard deviation, we take a arbitrary number of samples from the poulation and then calculate the standard deviation.

Sample Standard Deviation = s = (Σ xi – μ) / √(n − 1)
where

xi is a list of randomly selected elements from the population

μ is the mean of the new list

n is the sample size of the elements in the new list
