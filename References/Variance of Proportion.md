Variance of sample proportion

What is Variance of sample proportion?

The variance of sample proportion is similar to the variance of the population proportion. The difference in variance of sample proportion is that it is calculated for a randomly selected sample from the entire population.

Calculating the variance of sample proportion

In order to calculate the sample standard deviation, we take a arbitrary number of samples from the poulation and then calculate the standard deviation.

Variance of sample proportion = Sp2 = pq / (n - 1)
where

P is the probability that an event will occur

Q is the probability that the event won't occur

n is the sample size of the elements in the new list
